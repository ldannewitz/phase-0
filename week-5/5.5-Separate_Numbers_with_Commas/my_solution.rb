# Numbers to Commas Solo Challenge

# I spent [] hours on this challenge.

# Complete each step below according to the challenge directions and include it in this file. Also make sure everything that isn't code is commented in the file.

# 0. Pseudocode

# What is the input?
# Positive integer
# What is the output? (i.e. What should the code return?)
# Comma-separated integer as a STRING
# What are the steps needed to solve the problem?

# separate_comma(1000)     #=> "1,000"
# separate_comma(1000000) # => "1,000,000"
# separate_comma(0)       # => "0"
# separate_comma(100)     # => "100"

Anything < 1,000 can return input as string, no commas
Anything < 1,000,000 will have one comma


# 1. Initial Solution
def separate_comma(integer)

end
