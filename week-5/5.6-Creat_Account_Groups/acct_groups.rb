#Release 1: PSEUDOCODE:
-Input: array of names
-Output: Random groups of 3-5 people (2d array)
-Steps:
IF list has 5 people or less, create 1 group
Shuffle list of names
Create groups of 5 w/o leaving < 3 people at end
Create groups of 4 w/o leaving < 3 people at end
Create groups of 3 people
Print groups to console

#Release 2: Initial Solution
def account_group(list)
  return list if list.length <= 5
  shuffled = list.shuffle
  sorted_list = []
  while shuffled.length % 5 >= 3 || shuffled.length % 5 == 0
    sorted_list << shuffled.slice!(0..4)
    break if shuffled.length < 5
  end
  while shuffled.length % 4 >= 3 || shuffled.length % 4 == 0
    sorted_list << shuffled.slice!(0..3)
    break if shuffled.length < 4
  end
  while shuffled.length > 0
    sorted_list << shuffled.slice!(0..2)
  end
  sorted_list.reject { |a| a.empty? }

  sorted_list.each_with_index { |a, i|
    puts "Group #{i + 1}: " + a.join(", ")
    puts
    }
end


#Release 3: Add complexity
# 1. If you run this program three times in a row, will the program give you three different outputs?
#--YES, it was actually kind of annoying while trying to compare the test outputs

# 2. Should the program store past outputs?
#--Nah, once you have the groups its job is done.

#3 If one person were to leave the cohort, how would the accountability groups change?
#--Depends when they left and how many people were in the group. If someone left early on and the group only had 2 remaining members, I'd try to add them to another 3 person group or split them into two 4 person groups if necessary.

#4 How do you decide when you're done? You'll need to decide. This is much more challenging than you probably think, especially since there are no pre-written tests.
#--Well mathematically there are only so many possibilities. At some point your just adding multiples of previous solutions, so at least from that angle there is a pretty clear stopping point. My method produced satisfactory results for list sizes 1-12 and also for the cohort list, so I was happy where I left it.

#Release 6: Reflect
1. What was the most interesting and most difficult part of this challenge?
--I loved this challenge! The most interesting part was using new methods. The most difficult part was structuring the sequential logic. I originally made the "math part" WAY more complicated than necessary. I had to step away from the problem for a minute and let it settle, but then it just kind of clicked.

2. Do you feel you are improving in your ability to write pseudocode and break the problem down?
--Slowly, very very slowly. I paired on this challenge, and my pair already had a partial solution (completely different from above) when I joined him. That made it hard for me to pseudocode because we just jumped into making his idea work. I eventually drifted toward the above solution, and when we took a break I pseudocoded it.

3. Was your approach for automating this task a good solution? What could have made it even better?
--I think our approach is good. The only thing I would change is the approach for groups of 8. Our solution splits 8 people into 2 groups, 5 and 3. I think 4 and 4 makes more sense, but the logic to implement 4-4 only works for multiples of 8 (I think) so the code gets lengthier.

4. What data structure did you decide to store the accountability groups in and why?
--We used a 2d array. I'm not sure how to elegantly vocalize why. A hash doesn't make sense here because we don't have keys and values; we just have chunks of names. Because the list starts as an array, it was easier to slice off chunks into a new array, and the 2d array organizes the groups/names easily.

5. What did you learn in the process of refactoring your initial solution? Did you learn any new Ruby methods?
--Our initial solution produced an extra empty array on the end of the output for a list of 10 names. We're still not sure exactly what causes this since it doesn't happen with 8 or 6 names, but we found a way to fix it. We used #reject to get rid of the empty array.
--We also used #each_with_index to format the groups into a more readable output.
