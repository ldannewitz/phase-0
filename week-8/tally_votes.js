//        IF person they voted for is in votecount, increase count by 1
//        ELSE add person they voted for to votecount with count of 1
// Store votes in voteCount
// Determine which student has most votes for each position
// - create a function that accepts the object with the names and their
//   number of votes as an argument.
// - set a counter variable equal to 0
// - and an empty string variable that will hold the name of the winner
// - IF the number of votes is greater than the counter
//      counter equals to number of votes
//      winner = the name of the person
// - ELSE, keep counter and winner the same
