2. As a user, sum should give me the sum of ALL of the elements in an array that has an odd number of elements.
3. As a user, sum should give me the sum of ALL of the elements in an array that has an even number of elements.

Input: array of numbers
Output: integer
Steps:

--Take input array and sum numbers
--Return sum


---MEAN---
4. As a user, I want to have a function called mean.
5. As a user, mean should give me the average of ALL of the elements in an array that has an odd number of elements.  I need an exact amount, not a rounded integer.
6. As a user, mean should give me the average of ALL of the elements in an array that has an even number of elements.  I need an exact amount, not a rounded integer.

Input: array of numbers
Output: float
Steps:
-Define mean function
--Store array length as elements variable
--Take input array and sum numbers
--Convert sum to float
--Divide sum by elements and store as mean variable
--Return mean

---MEDIAN---
7. As a user, I want to have a function called median.
8. As a user, median should give me the median value of ALL of the elements in an array that has an odd number of elements.

Input:
Output:
Steps:
-Define median function
--Take input array and sum numbers
--Convert sum to float
--Divide sum by two and store as median variable
--Return median
