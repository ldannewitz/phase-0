**Numbers and Letters Reflection:**

1. What does puts do?
  * Puts returns nil and prints the output to terminal with a new line

1. What is an integer? What is a float?
  * An integer is a number without a decimal (ex. 13), and a float is a number with a decimal (ex. 2.5).

1. What is the difference between float and integer
division? How would you explain the difference to someone who doesn't know anything about programming?
  * Float division will give you a more accurate mathematical answer if the division would result in a remainder because the answer will include a decimal and the following digits (ex. 5.0 / 2.0 ==> 2.5).
  * Integer division essentially rounds the answer down and only results in the integer part of the answer (ex. 5 / 2 ==> 2).

**Mini-Challenges:**

*Hours in a Year:*
```ruby
puts "Hours in a Year"
puts 24*365
```
*Minutes in a Decade:*
```ruby
puts "Minutes in a Decade"
puts 60*24*(365*10 + 2)
```

**Reflection Continued (and some repetition):**

1. How does Ruby handle addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division of numbers?
  * Addition +
  * Subtraction -
  * Multiplication *
  * Division /

1. What is the difference between integers and floats?
  * An integer is any whole number, positive or negative (ex. 13). A float is any number with a decimal (ex. 13.0).

1. What is the difference between integer and float division?

  * Integer division essentially rounds the answer down and only results in the integer part of the answer (ex. 5 / 2 ==> 2).

1. What are strings? Why and when would you use them?
  * A string is a group of letters, symbols, or spaces. You would use them for all sorts of things, like the variable for someone's first name ("Lisa").

1. What are local variables? Why and when would you use them?
  * Local variables have a home in the place they are assigned and cannot be used outside of it. For example, you might use local variables with methods so that variables *outside* the method cannot affect the variables *inside* the method and vice versa.

1. How was this challenge? Did you get a good review of some of the basics?
  * Yes, this challenge was fairly easy but a good review, especially for string class methods.
