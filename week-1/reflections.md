# 1.1 Think About Time Reflection
  * One of the more tedious aspects of being a lawyer is tracking my time, every day, down to 6 minute intervals. As cumbersome as that can be, it has rather effectively taught me to be aware of exactly how I spend my time. Currently I manage my time by thinking about 1) how long a task “should” take; 2) how long the task realistically will take; and 3) ways to keep those two figures close. For longer tasks I use smaller segments to track my progress, and I reevaluate my approach as I go if I am missing my time estimates. The rough timeline keeps me focused, and the strategy works well for me.
  * Time Boxing involves working for a predetermined amount of time, or timebox, and then stopping to evaluate what was accomplished. For example, the Pomodoro Technique utilizes a kitchen timer set for 25 minute timeboxes. Time Boxing is a more rigid format of my current strategy and could be useful in Phase 0 to identify areas where I might struggle before I’ve invested hours into a simple problem.
  * I also researched goal-setting techniques and meditation because I could stand to improve my focus and mindfulness. The internet can be a wonderful place, but it can also be a black-hole for the unfocused curiosity. My mind also tends to wander if I have chores or personal problems bouncing around in the background. During my research I saved a few particularly inspiring quotes to help focus me. “Starting and getting momentum is the hardest part. Getting insanely micro is the cure.” My Phase 0 plan is to constantly set small goals for myself to avoid becoming overwhelmed and procrastinating. I am also going to start meditating daily (somewhat skeptically) in the hopes that I can silence some of the background noise and improve my focus.


# 1.2 The Command Line Reflection
1. What is a shell? What is "bash?"
  * A shell is the program or user interface that takes in user input through a command line interface (like terminal) or a graphical user interface (like finder) and communicates with the operating system. Bash is a type of shell that is prevalent today.
2. What was the most challenging for you in going through this material?
  * The video by Steven Harms was the most challenging part of the material because he covered a lot of material quickly and dove right into complex topics before covering the basics. I feel like I should watch it again now that I have completed the Crash Course.
3. Were you able to successfully use all of the commands?
  * Yes, all of the main ones covered in the crash course. Although I tried some of the commands explained in the man pages with mixed success.
4. In your opinion, what are the most important commands and arguments to know?
  * For me “ls” was important because I kept forgetting what files were in what directories, especially when I started copying and deleting. Also as a novice it gave me a confidence boost when I was able to check my work and see that everything was where it should be. “Less” also seems important when working with any large amount of text.
5. Can you remember what each of the following does of the top of your head? Write what each does.
  * -pwd = print working directory, shows the current directory
  * ls = list, shows the contents of the directory
  * mv = move
  * cd = change directory
  * ../ = changes the directory one directory up the path
  * touch = creates a new file
  * mkdir = creates a new directory
  * less = displays the paginated text of a file
  * rmdir = remove directory
  * rm = remove
  * help = or man, shows the help pages


# 1.4 Forking and Cloning Reflection
1. If you were going to write instructions for a new person on how to create a new repo, fork a repo, and clone a repo, what would they be? Why would you fork a repository as opposed to create a new one?
  * To create a new repo, log onto your GitHub account. From the main page, click on the “+” in the top right corner and choose “New Repository.”
  * To fork a repo, click on the “Fork” button in the top right of the repo page. A dialog box will ask “Where should we fork this repository?” Choose the button with your username.
  * To clone a repo, look for the toolbar about midway down the repo page with options Branch, New pull request, New file, Find file, HTTPS, url, Save, and Download ZIP. Copy the url. In the command line, go to the directory where you would like to clone the repository. Type “git clone [COPIED URL]” Hit enter. Type your username and password if prompted.
  * You would fork a repository instead of creating a new one to avoid repeating work. If you wanted to spin a project off in a new direction, you could fork the repository and make your changes without affecting the other user’s work.
2. What struggles did you have setting up git and GitHub? What did you learn in the process?
  * I followed the directions for git and GitHub step-by-step and consequently did not have any real struggles with the setup. I learned how to create, fork, and clone repositories.
