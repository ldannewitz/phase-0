# My Website 1 Reflection
1. Paste a link to your [USERNAME].github.io repository.
  * https://github.com/ldannewitz/ldannewitz.github.io
2. Explain how to create a repository on GitHub and clone the repository to your local computer to a non-technical person.
  * To create a new repo, log onto your GitHub account. From the main page, click on the “+” in the top right corner and choose “New Repository.” To clone a repo, look for the toolbar about midway down the repo page with options Branch, New pull request, New file, Find file, HTTPS, url, Save, and Download ZIP. Copy the url. In the command line, go to the directory where you would like to clone the repository. Type “git clone [URL]” Hit enter. Type your username and password if prompted.
3. Describe what open source means.
  * Open source means anyone can see the source code behind a program, not just the computer output. Developers may then copy, edit, or share the program.
4. What do you think about Open Source? Does it make you nervous or protective? Does it feel like utopia?
  * I think open source serves an important role in the developer community. It easily allows for open collaboration, and it encourages the spread of information to those who seek it. I might feel protective if I wanted to monetize a project because open source seems to undercut those opportunities. I feel like it would not be hard to accidentally contaminate a proprietary code with open source code and find yourself in a legal situation. So no, I wouldn't say it feels like utopia yet.
5. Assess the importance of using licenses.
  * Licenses protect the rights of the original owner/creator while allowing others use of the software.
6. What concepts were solidified in the challenge? Did you have any "aha" moments? What did you struggle with?
  * The content made sense as I was following along through the lesson, but writing this reflection finally provided that "aha" moment. After creating this file and starting to write, I noticed a few minor formatting errors in my prior two reflections. In fixing those errors, I accidentally pushed an incomplete version of this reflection to my account. Long story short, I went around in a few circles, deleted this file and the feature-branch, and finally got everything squared away. Annoying? Yes. Do I feel much more confident about the process now? Yes :)
7. Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.
