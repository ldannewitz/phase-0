Wireframe Reflection

1.What is a wireframe?
  * A wireframe is a simple blueprint of a website. It's the first step in the design process and allows for experimenting and tweaking of a website idea. The elements are usually kept simple, just enough to give an idea of the layout of the site.

1.What are the benefits of wireframing?
  * Wireframing allows you to visually brainstorm before diving too far into the CSS or HTML. Because you are using basic components, you can add, remove, change, and move components around easily. Wireframing also allows you to get client feedback very early on in the project.

1.Did you enjoy wireframing your site?
  * Not at first! I was completely overwhelmed. I haven't had to do any type of artistic or design work in quite some time, so I didn't really know where to start. Once I jumped in the process became more enjoyable.

1.Did you revise your wireframe or stick with your first idea?
  * I revised parts of it slightly. I kept most of the same components from my first idea, but I moved them around.

1.What questions did you ask during this challenge? What resources did you find to help you answer them?
  * I was really confused about how large the wireframe was supposed to be. The article "A Beginners Guide to Wireframing" suggested 1280 x 900. I actually didn't research the issue further, but considering that article is from 2012 maybe I should. I also used a pixel converter to try and grasp what "1280" even meant.

1.Which parts of the challenge did you enjoy and which parts did you find tedious?
  * I originally drew my wireframe with paper and pencil, and I think I'll continue to do this with future projects. For an initial step it was more enjoyable for me than the digital wireframing, which was tedious at times. With the digital I kept accidentally moving components when I was simply trying to click on them. I also have OCD tendencies, so it was hard not to focus on everything being perfectly centered and spaced.
