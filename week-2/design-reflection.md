2. What is your site's primary goal or purpose?
   What kind of content will your site feature?
  * The site's primary goal is to introduce myself and
    my work to potential employers. Therefore, my site
    will feature personal and contact information, my
    professional background, projects, technical blog, etc.

3. What is your target audience's interests and
   how do you see your site addressing them?
  * The target audience is employers, and their interests are in finding qualified people who could add something to their organization. My site will need to address how I fit that role.

4. What is the primary "action" the user should take when coming to your site? Do you want them to search for information, contact you, or see your portfolio? It's ok to have several actions at once, or different actions for different kinds of visitors.
  * If the user is someone I've reached out to or someone I am going to interview with, the primary action for them on my site is information gathering. I want them to get a feel of who I am. They don't necessarily have to contact me through the site.
  * If the user is any other potential employer who I am not already communicating with, the primary action I want them to take is to contact me.

5. What are the main things someone should know about design and user experience?
  * There is no right answer to design, and every design project will be different depending on the client and users. That's why Information Gathering is such a crucial role in the design process. A clothing retail site for senior citizens should have a completely different feel to it than one for teenagers, so information like "target audience" is necessary to know from Stage 1.
  * User experience studies how a user feels as they interact with a site. It is more qualitative in nature, and thus can be harder to collect meaningly data on.

6. What is user experience design and why is it valuable?
  * User experience design incorporates findings on user experience into the web design. Where web design guesses what users want and what will work on a site, user experience looks at feedback and surveys from actual users. It's valuable because it essentially tests the hypotheses that went into the web design.

7. Which parts of the challenge did you find tedious?
  * After completing my Week 1 Peer Reviews, watching the four Week 2 videos, and reading the two required readings for this unit, I was pretty anxious to get back into the command line and sublime. I skipped the optional readings because I needed a break from the hands-off learning. I plan to circle back.
