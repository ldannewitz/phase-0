1. What was it like to translate your previous learning with HTML into an actual site?
-It was great! It was fun to be able to combine all of the small things we had learned into one place and to see an actual site take shape.

2. How was it researching and using semantic HTML5 elements?
-It was fine. We had to google a few things and refer back to reference websites, but in the end we figured out the answers. Things we had hiccups with: <section> tags, the image relative link and alt attribute, and the registered and copyright marks.

3. How did you do at keeping to best practices (i.e. no formatting in the HTML)
-I think this part was pretty straightforward for us. We focused on getting the shell of the site together and all of the content in the right order.

4. What seems good and bad about HTML?
-The good: it's used across all websites, so once you learn it it's a powerful skill. It also seems extremely customizeable with endless options.
-The bad: those endless options can lead to long codes for simple things, and the opening/closing tags can be difficult to keep track of.

5. What tricks do you have for remembering how to write HTML?
-Repetition? I'm not sure I have any tricks, but the more times I use it the easier it is to remember.
